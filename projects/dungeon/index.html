<h1 id="dungeon_by_xsanda">Dungeon by Xsanda</h1>

<p>You <code class='cyan'>()</code> are trapped in a dungeon with many levels. You can advance each level by collecting all the available coins <code class='yellow'>$1</code> from each level. But beware, there are traps <code class='red'>&gt;&lt;</code> waiting to kill you, and monsters <code class='red'>M!</code> eager to eat you. There are even portals <code class='magenta'>&gt;1</code> to whisk you away to another part of the dungeon. As the game gets harder, you can also earn lives <code class='green'>+1</code>, and use them to overcome the threats of the dungeons.</p>

<p>The dungeon is a loop, so running away is not an option. Travel too far in one direction, and you’ll just end up back where you started. Sometimes, the dungeon is so large that it can’t all be seen at once. Just walk towards the edge of your vision, and more will appear.</p>

<p>The controls: <code>↑←↓→</code> to move, <code>WASD</code> to pan the map. Press <code>^C</code> or <code>Esc</code> at any time to exit.</p>

<p>The game runs in <code>python3</code>. Currently it only works on Unix-based machines (Mac, Linux), but Windows support is coming soon.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at a game, and my first time with Python, so feel free to suggest any improvements.</p>

<p>To install, download the installer to where you would like to run it, then open it with <code>python3</code>.</p>
