  # Hello! I'm Charlie Harding

  Iâ€™m a software engineer for [QAware](https://www.qaware.de/), based in Munich, Germany.
  I studied Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

  My main technical interests are in frontend development and digital mapping.
  In my free time, I like spending time in the mountains: hiking, running, road cycling and skiing.
