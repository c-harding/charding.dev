# [charding.dev](https://charding.dev/)

This is my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages.
It uses a home-made static site generator, written in Ruby.
The HTML builder can be seen in [`build/html.rb`](https://github.com/xsanda/charding.dev/blob/main/build/html.rb), and it is built on every commit, using GitHub Actions.
The result is pushed to the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/xsanda/charding.dev/tree/gh-pages) branch.
